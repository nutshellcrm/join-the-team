# Nutshell Front-end Engineer Take Home Project (2020)

## Tic Tac Toe App
Hello and welcome to Nutshell’s Front-end Engineer take-home project! The goal of this exercise is to **create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game** in the browser.

To help set expectations, we believe this should take under 3-4 hours to complete. We understand that you have other responsibilities, so if you think you’ll need more than 3-4 days, just let us know when you expect to send a reply.

### Features to include

_Note: While it would be cool to allow both players to use their own device, for this exercise, we’ll assume that both players are playing on the **same** device._

- If a player gets 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), the game should end, and announce which player has won
- When the game ends (either in a tie, or someone winning) there’s a way to "Play again"
- If a player makes a mistake, they have the ability to "Undo" their last move

### Deploying / Sending us your work

Forking and modifying your own version of [This Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/affectionate-hellman-i842l) is probably the easiest way to get started right away, but if you’d prefer to use something like `create-react-app` and make your own repository, that’s fine too! Nothing is off the table; we only ask that you do use React, as that’s the framework we use at Nutshell.
