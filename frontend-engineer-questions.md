# Nutshell Front-end Engineer Take Home Project (2022)
Hello and welcome to Nutshell’s Front-end Engineer take-home project! Our take home is split into two parts. To help set expectations, we believe this should take under 3-4 hours to complete. We understand that you have other responsibilities, so if you think you’ll need more time to get started, just let us know when you expect to send a reply.

## Part 1: Written questions

To start, we ask all candidates to answer the following questions. A paragraph or two each is probably about right:

1. What's your proudest achievement? It can be from work, a side project, or something unrelated to tech. We're interested in knowing about what you think is noteworthy and motivating.
2. Tell us about an interesting work-related book, article, or presentation that you saw recently. Tell us why, give us a recommendation, and sell us on it!
3. From what you’ve seen on our web site, write about who Nutshell’s customers are, and what problems they’re looking to solve.
4. Describe something that you do outside of work that's least similar to what you do at work.
5. Describe something you do at work that's furthest from your official description.
6. Tell us about the last time you had to reconsider a closely-held opinion. What caused your change in thinking?



## Part 2: Tic Tac Toe App

The goal of this exercise is to **recreate the game Tic Tac Toe** in the browser.

### Features to include

_Note: While it would be cool to allow both players to use their own device, for this exercise, we’ll assume that both players are playing on the **same** device._

- If a player gets 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), the game should end, and announce which player has won
- When the game ends (either in a tie, or someone winning) there’s a way to "Play again"
- If a player makes a mistake, they have the ability to "Undo" their last move

### Deploying / Sending us your work

Forking and modifying your own version of [This Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/affectionate-hellman-i842l) is probably the easiest way to get started right away, but if you’d prefer to use something like `create-react-app` and make your own repository, that’s fine too! Nothing is off the table; we only ask that you do use React, as that’s the framework we use at Nutshell.
