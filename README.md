# Join us and build beautiful software at Nutshell.

At [Nutshell](https://www.nutshell.com/), we’re building beautiful software to help businesses grow. We’re looking for software developers and designers to join our team.

For all candidates, we kick off our hiring process with a few questions via email. We think that this is a more fair and effective way to understand your skills, as compared to an in-person whiteboard interview. (We didn’t invent this, though — [we copped the idea from Intercom](https://blog.intercom.com/how-we-hire-engineers-part-1/)!)

**You can email us at [jobs@nutshell.com](mailto:jobs@nutshell.com) to get things started.**

We have a few written answers and technical questions for software designers & developers:

- [Take home for **software engineer interns (2021)**](internship-take-home.md)
- [Take home for **back-end engineers (2021)**](backend-questions-2021.md)
