# Join us and build beautiful software at Nutshell.

At [Nutshell](https://www.nutshell.com/), we’re building beautiful software to help small businesses grow. We’re looking for software developers and designers to join our team.

For all candidates, we kick off the interview process with a few questions via email. We think that this is a more fair and effective way to understand your skills, as compared to an in-person whiteboard interview. (We didn’t invent this, though — [we copped the idea from Intercom](https://blog.intercom.com/how-we-hire-engineers-part-1/)!)

To help set expectations, we believe this should take under 3-4 hours to complete. We understand that you have other responsibilities, so if you think you’ll need more than 3-4 days, just let us know when you expect to send a reply.

On our end, we’ll commit to getting back to you in 2-3 business days.

**You can email us at [jobs@nutshell.com](mailto:jobs@nutshell.com) to get things started.**

---

To start, **we ask all candidates** to answer the following questions:

1. What is your proudest achievement? It can be from work, a side project, or something unrelated to tech. We're interested in knowing about what you think is noteworthy and motivating. A paragraph or two is fine!
2. Tell us about an interesting technical book, article, or presentation that you saw recently. Tell us why, give us a recommendation!
3. From what you’ve seen on our web site, write a paragraph about who Nutshell’s customers are, and what problems they’re looking to solve.

Along with the above questions, we have different projects for software designers & developers:

- [Take home problems for software **designers**](designer-questions.md)
- [Take home problems for software **developers**](developer-questions.md)
