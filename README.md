# Join us and build beautiful software at Nutshell.

At [Nutshell](https://www.nutshell.com/), we’re building beautiful software to help businesses grow. We’re looking for software developers and designers to join our team.

For all candidates, we kick off our hiring process with a few questions via email. We think that this is a more fair and effective way to understand your skills, as compared to an in-person whiteboard interview. (We didn’t invent this, though — [we copped the idea from Intercom](https://blog.intercom.com/how-we-hire-engineers-part-1/)!)

**You can email us at [jobs@nutshell.com](mailto:jobs@nutshell.com) to get things started.**

---

To start, **we ask all candidates** to answer the following questions. A paragraph or two each is probably about right:

1. What's your proudest achievement? It can be from work, a side project, or something unrelated to tech. We're interested in knowing about what you think is noteworthy and motivating.
2. Tell us about an interesting work-related book, article, or presentation that you saw recently. Tell us why, give us a recommendation, and sell us on it!
3. From what you’ve seen on our web site, write about who Nutshell’s customers are, and what problems they’re looking to solve.
4. Describe something that you do outside of work that's _least_ similar to what you do at work.
5. Describe something you do _at_ work that's furthest from your official description.
6. Tell us about the last time you had to reconsider a closely-held opinion. What caused your change in thinking?

Along with the above questions, we have different projects for software designers & developers:

- [Take home problems for software **designers**](designer-questions.md)
- [Take home problems for software **developers**](developer-questions.md)
